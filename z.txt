What I want?
1. Always be prepared to answer any question I ask regarding the project.
2. This project is done individually by me (with the option to seek your help as needed).
3. I have already completed the following setups:
   - Hostinger and Vercel for backend and frontend hosting.
   - Figma for design and initial project structure.
   - GitHub repository and linked Kanban projects.
   - Integrated GitHub with Hostinger and Vercel for automatic deployments.
   - Local development environment:
     - Next.js is set up and running normally in VS Code.
     - PHP setup uses Local, with all default WordPress files removed, working in VS Code.

4. Whenever I message `Day {number}`, treat it as a task request for that day's work, I can ask you in a single day by using Day {number) for multiple days in one day to create issue in advance. 
   - Create GitHub Kanban issues for the tasks of that day.
   - I may create issues for multiple days at once.
   - Each issue should be detailed in markdown with the following sections:
     - **Title**: A concise issue title - Not in markdown.
     - **Label**: Labels of tasks like documentaion, design, improvement, performance, good-first issue or more depend on issue.
    - **Priority** -  Priority of task for day over other task of that day, an be only P0,P1,and P2 higherst to lowest.
     - **Description**: Provide an overview of the issue, scope and dependence, if any.
     - **Tasks and Sub-Tasks**: Clearly outline steps, marking whether each task is for the frontend, backend, or both. Example:
       - [ ] Sub-task description - {backend or frontend or backend/frontend}.
     - **Additional Explanation and Notes**: Include any relevant information, if needed.

5. If a task involves multiple large steps or pages, divide it into smaller sub-tasks.
6. Ensure every day's tasks are divided into 2, 3, or more issues , depending on the complexity of the task and days will be depending as defined in "Step-by-Step Making Timeline".
7. Follow consistent markdown formatting throughout the project.
8. A single issue may involve both backend and frontend tasks.
9. Always remember the context of previous chats when responding.

### Markdown Styling Requirements for Issues

- **Use proper and consistent styling for all markdown content.**
- Ensure clarity and conciseness in task descriptions.
- Example markdown format:
 Issue Title: [Brief Title Here]
Labels (can have multiple for 1 issue)
Priority (P0,1,2)
  ```markdown
  ### Description
  Provide a brief description of the issue and its purpose.

  ### Tasks and Sub-Tasks
  - [ ] Sub-task 1 - {frontend or backend or backend/frontend}.
    - [ ] Sub-sub-tak 1
  - [ ] Sub-task 2 - {frontend or backend or backend/frontend}.
  - [ ] Sub-task 3 - {frontend or backend or backend/frontend}.

  ### Additional Explanation and Notes
  - Include any additional details, clarifications, or helpful tips if needed.
```

10. I can ask questions in the chat at any time, and You will provide answers while remembering the full context of the project from start to finish.
