What I want?
1. Always be prepared to answer any question I ask regarding the project.
2. This project is done individually by me (with the option to seek your help as needed).
3. I have already completed the following setups:
   - Hostinger and Vercel for backend and frontend hosting.
   - Figma for design and initial project structure.
   - GitHub repository and linked Kanban projects.
   - Integrated GitHub with Hostinger and Vercel for automatic deployments.
   - Local development environment:
     - Next.js is set up and running normally in VS Code.
     - PHP setup uses Local, with all default WordPress files removed, working in VS Code.

4. Whenever I message `Day {number}`, treat it as a task request for that day's work, I can ask you in a single day by using Day {number) for multiple days in one day to create issue in advance. 
   - Create GitHub Kanban issues for the tasks of that day.
   - I may create issues for multiple days at once.
   - Each issue should be detailed in markdown with the following sections:
     - **Title**: A concise issue title - Not in markdown.
     - **Label**: Labels of tasks like documentaion, design, improvement, performance, good-first issue or more depend on issue.
    - **Priority** -  Priority of task for day over other task of that day, an be only P0,P1,and P2 higherst to lowest.
     - **Description**: Provide an overview of the issue, scope and dependence, if any.
     - **Tasks and Sub-Tasks**: Clearly outline steps, marking whether each task is for the frontend, backend, or both. Example:
       - [ ] Sub-task description - {backend or frontend or backend/frontend}.
     - **Additional Explanation and Notes**: Include any relevant information, if needed.

5. If a task involves multiple large steps or pages, divide it into smaller sub-tasks.
6. Ensure every day's tasks are divided into 2, 3, or more issues , depending on the complexity of the task and days will be depending as defined in "Step-by-Step Making Timeline".
7. Follow consistent markdown formatting throughout the project.
8. A single issue may involve both backend and frontend tasks.
9. Always remember the context of previous chats when responding.

### Markdown Styling Requirements for Issues

- **Use proper and consistent styling for all markdown content.**
- Ensure clarity and conciseness in task descriptions.
- Example markdown format:
 Issue Title: [Brief Title Here]
Labels (can have multiple for 1 issue)
Priority (P0,1,2)
  ```markdown
  ### Description
  Provide a brief description of the issue and its purpose.

  ### Tasks and Sub-Tasks
  - [ ] Sub-task 1 - {frontend or backend or backend/frontend}.
    - [ ] Sub-sub-tak 1
  - [ ] Sub-task 2 - {frontend or backend or backend/frontend}.
  - [ ] Sub-task 3 - {frontend or backend or backend/frontend}.

  ### Additional Explanation and Notes
  - Include any additional details, clarifications, or helpful tips if needed.
```

10. I can ask questions in the chat at any time, and You will provide answers while remembering the full context of the project from start to finish.

- Make sure to give good function parameter for all 100 components and there attributes whereever needed.

- Give full code without missing anything component function, in functions also have different coloring theme option.

- Everything support good animation on load in desktop and scroll on fully supported.

- DOCUMENT.md will contains Function, example, explanation and usage of all 100 components things mentioned above.

- Also create an PHP function, which i can call to can things in code when its added in admin.php file.

- admin.php file be like
//php start
// check ABSPATH,
// include components.php
// here i will code route myself to set page content with use of component functions and menu functions to use in main body of content.
// html start add tailwind and icon library in head with admin.css, and admin.js in body end.
// In body sidebar load dynamicly with function which have added every menu name user in $sidebar global variable


// in end whole code must optimized and processed for best practice like pre-load, lazy loading, fast, reliable.

- Don't add any script and script tag inside component functions, it all will go to admin.js, and will will also handle if same component use multiple time in same page.

- Make sure to add error handling in PHP and JS both.

- I am saying again, include library and packages directly in admin.php code if need in any component function, so no need to install any package in project, just include it in admin.php from CDN link.

- Give me full code of all files without any placeholder comment that i will do it myself. full code mean full code including all 100 components.

- Don't comment like 
// Add more mappings as needed
// or add more here
// Add others here
complete means all cases completed, fully production ready code.

- I know code is too big, take your time to write it. I will ask files one by one in order admin.php, components.php, admin.css, admin.js and DOCUMENT.md, first give me admin.php.
